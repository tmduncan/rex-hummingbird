# Project Hummingbird

Project Hummingbird is a marketing platform for intelligently targeting potential home buyers and sellers.

## Features

- Track Google Adwords spend and effectiveness
- Create shortened urls for print advertizing
- Create ad links for ad platforms
- Analyze data about the entities being targeted

## Non-goals

- Not a demand side platform managing all the posible ads on the internet
- Not a cms or portal for landing pages

## Dependencies

This app was created using React-Boilerplate (https://www.reactboilerplate.com/).

The project will use:
- docker for deployment
- python for the backend (because Google Adwords supports it and not node)
- react-redux for the frontend UI (using React-Boilerplate (https://www.reactboilerplate.com/))
- bootstrap for the HTML, CSS, and JS framework
